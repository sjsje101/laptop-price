# 💻 Laptop Price Predictor

A **Machine Learning** web app that predicts laptop prices based on specifications like **brand, processor, RAM, storage**, and **screen resolution**.

---

## ✨ What It Does

- Predicts prices of laptops using user inputs.
- Trained multiple ML models and picked the best.
- Built a full pipeline with **preprocessing, encoding**, and **scaling**.
- Deployed using **Flask** with a simple web interface.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Tech

- 🐍 Python, scikit-learn, pandas, Flask  
- ☁️ Google Colab (for training)  
- 💻 PyCharm (for app building)  
- 📦 Pickle (for model saving)

---

## 🧠 Workflow

- **EDA & Preprocessing:** Cleaned data, used One-Hot Encoding (OHE), and scaled features using `Pipeline`.
- **Model Training:** Tested multiple regression models like **Linear Regression, Ridge, and Random Forest**, and chose the best.
- **Model Exporting:** Saved the final model using `pickle`.
- **Web App:** Developed a **Flask** web app for local predictions with a clean UI.
